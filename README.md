## Authentication

Both, access token and refresh token use HttpOnly and Secure attributes to ensure that the cookies are not accessible through client-side scripts and are only sent over HTTPS connections. Access token with Host prefix and Refresh token with Secure prefix. Also, the Path attribute for the refresh token is set to 'api/refresh' to limit the number of requests it is attached to. When the access token expires and the requested page requires it, the server returns the component that makes a request to 'api/refresh' on behalf of the user. If the refresh token has expired, the user is logged out. Otherwise, a refreshed access token is set in response. The process is similar when the user wants to change the password: the access token expires, the request sent to the server fails, a request to 'api/refresh' is made on behalf of the user, and a new access token is set, repeating the change password request. Additionally, the refresh token has the SameSite attribute set to 'strict', ensuring that it is attached to deliberate actions taken by the user.
